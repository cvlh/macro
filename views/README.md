# Visual Programming

With **Visual Programming** you can enable non-technical users to create and manage applications using a visual user interface (drag-and-drop) rather than writing or editing lines of code.

This can simplify application development and allow users to build applications faster, at a lower price point, and with fewer bugs than traditional code-based approaches.

Never struggle with the lack of information again, you can streamline your workflows in a simple way, provide online forms and define what information is mandatory and how it should be submitted throughout the entire process.

Use the concept of visibility to guide the user through every step of the activity.
